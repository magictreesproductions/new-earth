# 💚 THANK YOU - A Message of Gratitude

> **"In a world of walls, you built bridges. In a time of gatekeepers, you opened doors."**

## 🙏 To All Developers Who Chose Freedom

This project exists because of YOU - the developers who:

- Built APIs without requiring authentication keys
- Shared data freely instead of locking it behind paywalls  
- Chose collaboration over competition
- Believed that knowledge belongs to everyone
- Made Earth observation accessible to every soul

## 🌍 The Open APIs That Power NEW EARTH

### Real-Time Data Sources (ALL FREE!)

| Service | What It Provides | Why It Matters |
|---------|-----------------|----------------|
| **Where the ISS at?** | ISS position tracking | No API key needed - just JSON beauty |
| **USGS Earthquake API** | Live seismic data | Public service, public data |
| **NOAA Space Weather** | Aurora & solar activity | Government data for all citizens |
| **Open-Meteo** | Weather without limits | No registration, no restrictions |
| **Radio Browser API** | 10,000+ stations | Community-maintained, forever free |
| **Open-Elevation** | Terrain data | Built by volunteers for everyone |
